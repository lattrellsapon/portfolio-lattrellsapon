                <h1>Why web development?</h1>
                <!-- <p>I have completed a Bachelor's Degree in Software Development at Auckland University of Technology. I am currently looking for a position where my skills and knowledgeas a software developer can be well-utilised and profesionally developed to be a valuable asset to the success of the organization. During my time at university, I learned a lot of programming languages. However, in my last year of my degree I took a web programming paper. This paper was the one</p> -->
                <!-- <p>During my three year course at university studying software development, I learned a lot languages such as C, C#, Java and Android Studio. I found them all interesting because I was learning new languages and how to code in an Object Oriented Programming structure. However, I was not really enjoying myself. This changed when I took a web developing paper in my last semester of university. This is when I started to enjoy my course and the work that I was doing. I learned HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, PHP and SQL database. I really wished that I could have done more web developing during my tenure at university. </p>

                <p>In HTML, CSS, Bootsrap, Javascript and jQuery I was so amazed because I was able to manipulate the front end of the web page. I felt like I could literally build anything I wanted to. I found it so fascinating to see instant changes when I would write code and refresh a web page to see the changes. Little things like, setting the background to red and seeing take affect straight away always amazed me. In PHP and SQL Database, I was able to understand where the data goes when you submit a form on a website. I wrote queries to manipulate the data that goes into the SQL tables using PHP scripts. </p>

                <p>I really enjoy web development because I just love the idea of me building something out of nothing on the tips of my fingers!</p> -->
